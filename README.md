1.we create an HTML header element with a class of "banner" to define the banner component. Inside the header, we have an h1 element that displays the site's title. The CSS code in the "styles.css" file defines the styling for the banner and title.

You can customize the styles (e.g., background color, text color, font size) in the CSS to match your design preferences.

2.This code creates a simple exhibit component with a gray background, a title, and a description. You can customize the styles, fonts, colors, and content to match your desired design. Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS to create different styles of exhibit components, such as cards, panels, or tabs, based on your preferences.

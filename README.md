# Website-Banner-Component-Anas
we create an HTML header element with a class of "banner" to define the banner component. Inside the header, we have an h1 element that displays the site's title. The CSS code in the "styles.css" file defines the styling for the banner and title.

You can customize the styles (e.g., background color, text color, font size) in the CSS to match your design preferences.
